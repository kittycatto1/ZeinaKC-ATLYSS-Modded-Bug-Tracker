# ZeinaKC's ATLYSS Modded Bug Tracker (UNOFFICIAL)
Personal modded bug tracker for ATLYSS. Maintained by KittyCatto (ZeinaKC) with the goal of having easy access to modded troubleshooting information and keeping track of unresolved Bugs.

This isn't directly related to the mod authors (hence unofficial) and isn't the place to report bugs to get them resolved. Join the [Atlyss Modding Central Discord Server](https://discord.gg/hQceRJ7pEW) to get help with troubleshooting instead.

Use the issues page to help report things to the tracker with the usual troubleshooting standard. I don't know much about Pull Requests yet or have them configured, so don't use them.

Most of the info gathered is through all the testing I do for my [Modpacks](https://thunderstore.io/c/atlyss/p/ZeinaKC/?section=bundles), but also community contributions. I'll try to list who reported a bug where possible.
